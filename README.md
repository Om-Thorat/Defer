# Defer 🪄

Too many windows on your desktop?

* Have a meeting?
* need a break?

but don't want to loose the windows? **DEFER THEM!**

Just one click and all your windows go poof 🪄 
and another click to restore them all back to the exact state they were in 🎉

If that sounds appealing download the installer from [here!](https://github.com/Om-Thorat/Defer/releases/download/Main/Defer_1.0_x64_en-US.msi)
## Code 🧑🏽‍💻
The app is built with Rust for backend and Tauri with Svelte and TailwindCSS for frontend.

To edit the code just clone the repo and make sure to have Tauri installed!

All PRs are welcome and appreciated 🚀.
Please also create and issue if you face one, Thanks!
